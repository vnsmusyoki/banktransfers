Deploying a Laravel project on a server and on a local machine involves several steps. Here's a general procedure to follow:

Deploying the Project on a Server
Get a server and SSH access to it. You can rent a server from a hosting provider or use a cloud-based server like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Google Cloud Platform.
Install a web server (like Apache or Nginx) and PHP on the server.
Install a database server (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) on the server.
Install Composer on the server, which is a dependency manager for PHP.
Clone your Laravel project to the server using Git or FTP.
Install the project dependencies using Composer by running the command composer install in the project directory.
Create a .env file in the project directory and set the environment variables, including the database credentials, application key, and other settings.
Run the database migrations using the command php artisan migrate.
Configure the web server to point to the public directory of the Laravel project.
Restart the web server and check if the Laravel application is accessible by visiting the server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.
Deploying a Laravel Project on a Local Machine
Install a web server (like Apache or Nginx) and PHP on your local machine. Alternatively, you can use a pre-built development environment like XAMPP or Laragon.
Install a database server (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) on your local machine or use a cloud-based database service.
Install Composer on your local machine.
Clone your Laravel project to your local machine using Git or FTP.
Install the project dependencies using Composer by running the command composer install in the project directory.
Create a .env file in the project directory and set the environment variables, including the database credentials, application key, and other settings.
Run the database migrations using the command php artisan migrate.
Configure the web server to point to the public directory of the Laravel project. If you're using a pre-built development environment, this step may already be done for you.
Start the web server and check if the Laravel application is accessible by visiting http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 in a web browser.
Note: The exact steps may vary depending on your server and local machine setup. You may also need to configure the server's firewall or adjust the file permissions on the Laravel project files. It's recommended to consult the Laravel documentation and your server/local machine's documentation for more information.
